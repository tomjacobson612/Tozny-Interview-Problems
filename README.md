Your task is to write functions in the programming language of your choice which can operate on
the example JSON value below to answer the following questions
1. What are the 5 most expensive items from each category?
For example a javascript function that receives json input as a parameter and returns an
object consisting of 5 list of items, where each list contains the 5 most expensive items for a
given category (e.g. cd, book, or dvd) based on the inventory list input passed to the function

2. Which cds have a total running time longer than 60 minutes?
